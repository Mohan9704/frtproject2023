# Project Title : Fertilizer Recommender

# Problem Statement / Opportunity :

Fertilizer Recommendation system for crop disease prediction which recommends best fertilizers to use, the best crop to grow and diseases caught by your crops.

# Project Description :

Recommending the best fertilizer for every particular crop is a challenging task. And the othermost important issue is when a plant gets caught by heterogenous diseases that effect on less amount of agriculture production. To overcome all these issues this recommendation system has been proposed. This responsive website about fertilizer recommendation is hosted and deployed on Github and Microsoft Azure. I have included Azure Health Bot service as Crop-HealthBot to monitor the crops health based on its characteristics and Azure Maps service as Farm-locator to locate and reach to your farm in an easy manner.
